 Game Progamming Project - GeoQuest

GeoQuest is a platforming game with Geography elements infused into the gameplay. The goal of the game is to reach checkpoints, answer geography questions correctly, and move forward throughout the level. 

Watch your step when traversing the level, because falling to your death is still possible, and it will reset the level to the beginning. So watch your step and have fun answering Geography questions!
